In this tutorial, replace PATH_TO_YOUR_FLEXSLIDER_SCRIPT, PATH_TO_YOUR_FLEXSLIDER_CSS, PATH_TO_YOUR_MAGNIFIC_POPUP_SCRIPT, and PATH_TO_YOUR_MAGNIFIC_POPUP_CSS with your actual file paths. The paths are relative to your theme directory.

This tutorial explains how to add a FlexSlider and Magnific Popup to your WordPress theme. It creates a new shortcode 'acf_flexslider' that you can use in your posts or pages to display a slider with a popup. The images for the slider and popup are retrieved from a custom field 'service_gallery'.

Make sure to have the FlexSlider, Magnific Popup scripts, and their corresponding CSS files in your theme directory before trying to enqueue them. You can download these scripts and styles from the official FlexSlider and Magnific Popup websites or other trusted sources.
